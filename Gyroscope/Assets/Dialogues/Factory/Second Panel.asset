      Hello? Hello, do you hear me?'
  - speakerName: '#23354'
    sentence: Yes foreman, loud and clear.
  - speakerName: Foreman
    sentence: Please report in on the status of the power source.
  - speakerName: '#23354'
    sentence: We had a small snag down here, but the power source is stable now,
      sir. Some of the vessels though...
  - speakerName: Foreman
    sentence: Yes? What about them?
  - speakerName: '#23354'
    sentence: Well they... Uhm... They overloaded during the initial carry tests,
      sir. Their sentience and navigational systems were severely damaged, and their
      memory cores were all but wiped. They can still carry logs, but its very limited.
  - speakerName: Foreman
    sentence: Damn... Well, do we have any progress on the newer models at least?
  - speakerName: '#23354'
    sentence: Yes, sir, we are testing them right now. I'm a bit nervous about letting
      them near the source however.
  - speakerName: Foremand
    sentence: Have hex look at it, stat. We need results fast if we are going to
      make the deadline!

    sentence: 'Yes, sir...
