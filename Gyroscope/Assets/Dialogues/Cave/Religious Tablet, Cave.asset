  text: 'And then, we came. With tools and intellect, with questions and hunger,
    we came. And we dug the soil and the ground, shaped the rocks and the trees,
    made life in our own right. Even the roots of the Mother Tree we turned and twisted,
    as She began to wither and fade away. And as the last leafs fell from her shruken
    branches, He must have wept, for the sky opened, and from that day, the rotation
    of our world slowed. Untill we were almost still.


    And we were lost.'
