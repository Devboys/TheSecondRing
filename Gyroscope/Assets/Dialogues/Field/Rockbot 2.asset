    sentence: I am trying to make a log, what does it look like I'm doing?
  - speakerName: Voice 1
    sentence: You're doing it on that? Why exactly?
  - speakerName: Voice 2
    sentence: Easier to transport the log. Plus, it will keep far longer than on
      anything else.

    sentence: 'Right, so where was I?

      Yes, the way through the mountain...
      It hasnt been easy to gate the way to the generator,

      but I think we
      might have done it. You need a power source to go all the way through now,

      and
      even then, you would have to have a completely fresh one to go all the way
      through without being trapped by the crystals.

      It does seem inconvenient
      at first glance, but there is no reason to go to the generator unless you need
      to restart it, and for that,

      you need a power source.'

    sentence: But what if the thing runs out of power before the carrier gets all
      the way through?
  - speakerName: Voice 1
    sentence: ... That's actually a good point. I didn't think of that. We might
      have to change the design of the cave a bit.
