    sentence: Construction log 51. The cave has been sealed off on both sides with
      the receptor crystals to prevent unauthorized passage.

    sentence: The power flows... Strangely, inside the cave. We thought that the
      artificial powersource was enough, but it seems to ebb out.

      down the gullet. We cannot afford to lose any more.
