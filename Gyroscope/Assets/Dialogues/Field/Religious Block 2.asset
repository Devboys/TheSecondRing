    sentence: "Tranquility. Balance. Life.\r\n\nI was soaring, yet I was still. I
      was tiny, yet I was mighty.\nThe only thing I could do was keep singing, sing
      myself and this place I had come to, to life.\nAs my song made the golden,
      dark grass rise beneath me flourish, I grew as well. My body grew. My crown
      started to spread and cast shadows.\r\nAnd my voice. My voice grew too.\r\nBeneath
      me, the darkness was complete. My roots sunk deep into the soil,\ncrawling
      through with netted fingers, absorbing droplets of minerals, energy, liquid,
      empowering my growth and my song. And above me\u2026\r\n\nA sun."
