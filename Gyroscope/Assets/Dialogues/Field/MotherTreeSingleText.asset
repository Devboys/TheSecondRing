  text: "\"The song of the Mother Tree. May she forgive our transgressions against
    her.\"\n---\nTranquility. Balance. Life.\r\n\nI was soaring, yet I was still.
    I was tiny, yet I was mighty.\n\nThe only thing I could do was keep singing,
    sing myself and this place I had come to, to life.\nAs my song made the golden,
    dark grass rise beneath me flourish, I grew as well. My body grew. My crown started
    to spread and cast shadows.\r\nAnd my voice. My voice grew too.\r\nBeneath me,
    the darkness was complete. My roots sunk deep into the soil, crawling through
    with netted fingers, absorbing droplets of minerals, energy, liquid, empowering
    my growth and my song. And above me\u2026\r\n\nA warm, nourushing sun."
