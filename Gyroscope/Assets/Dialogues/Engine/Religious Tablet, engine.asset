  text: "As we saw our own doom approach, we knew that we were the perpetrators of
    it. As this worlds renewing life force withered and died in our hands, He wept
    bitter tears and lost the will to continue.\n\nBut we were stubborn, our will
    to live was strong. And so we toiled, crafted, invented, sacrificed. \n\nAnd
    now, we can continue on, continue  finding a way to escape Him, continue surviving...
    For a price."
